# Time Series Analysis using Machine Learning Models
### BITS F464 Machine Learning

## Introduction
The project's main purpose is to test  different hypothesis classes and hyperparameters for time series analysis, in this case, Stock Market Data. The dataset used in this project is a stock market information from this [Nifty50](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data) dataset.

The main objective of this project was to explore the capabilities of various regression models like:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Multi-Layer Perceptrons

We explored their ability to predict the future values of the stock market.  
The plots are made in Plotly to make them interactive, helping to analyse and explore the data.

## To run locally
To run the project on your local machine, run the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The command will install all the necessary libraries on the local machine. After that, the Python notebook can be run.
